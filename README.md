Conf Room Test
========

Create a conference booking screen, based on the mockup found at ref/mockup.jpg

The intention of the app is to let different teams inside the same company to book different conference rooms.

The screen should do the following.

 - Show existing reserves in the table above. Show with some data pre populated.
 - Allow users to create new reservations.
 - New reservations can not collide with existing ones for the same room, date and time.
 - Show proper error messages on validations errors.
 - The project will not be integrated with persistence services, but a simulation or code close as possible to doing api calls desired.
 - Dates and time objects should validate proper inputs and indicate in case of issues with the typed values.
 - Dates and time are free to implement either via simple text inputs or angular bootstrap components. Other third party libraries can be used as well.
 - Use bootstrap to layout the screen.

Note: The title info is not an input, rather just a header.
